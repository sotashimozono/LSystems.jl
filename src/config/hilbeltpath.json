    "description": "Standard space-filling curve tiling a square grid. By recursively mapping 2D coordinates to a 1D sequence, it preserves spatial locality more effectively than simple raster scanning. This makes it a cornerstone for designing 1D paths in Matrix Product State (MPS) simulations of 2D quantum systems.",
